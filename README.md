# Execution Layer : Reth

I went with Reth because I was curious about how rust was used in this context and want to learn more about Rust usage on the blockchain.

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum) is an Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, fast and efficient.

# Consensus Layer : Lighthouse  

I decided to go with Lighthouse because its usage is widely spread and is also built on rust.

Lighthouse is an Ethereum consensus client that connects to other Ethereum consensus clients to form a resilient and decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain.

Now we wait for reth to fully synch before calling the JSON RPC API methods
